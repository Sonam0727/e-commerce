Projects
1. E-commerce Customer Retention Analysis
Date: January 2025

Description:
In this project, I analyzed an e-commerce platform's customer dataset to identify factors affecting customer retention and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The analysis aimed to uncover actionable insights to improve customer loyalty and enhance business strategies. Key variables such as purchase date, amount spent, product category, region, and customer feedback were examined.

Tools and Techniques:

Python: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and clustering using K-means.
Excel: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
MySQL: Storing segmented customer data for querying insights on high-value customers and frequent buyers.
Power BI: Developing interactive dashboards to visualize customer retention patterns.
Dataset:
A synthetic e-commerce dataset with columns like Customer ID, Purchase Date, Amount Spent, Category, Region, and Customer Feedback.

Steps Taken:

Data Cleaning in Excel:

Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
Standardized date formats and ensured numeric values were consistent.
EDA and Clustering in Python:

Conducted exploratory analysis to uncover key patterns in customer behavior.
Used the K-means algorithm to segment customers into clusters based on their spending habits and frequency of purchases.
Performed outlier detection and normalization to ensure effective clustering.
Data Storage in MySQL:

Stored the segmented customer data into a MySQL database for querying insights like high-value customers and frequent buyers.
Visualization in Power BI:

Built dashboards to visualize customer retention patterns, spending trends, and regional insights.
Highlighted cluster-specific behaviors and identified customer segments requiring attention.
Key Insights:

Through this analysis, I identified critical factors impacting customer retention and purchasing behavior:

High-value customers typically belonged to the electronics and fashion categories.
Customers from the South region exhibited higher average spending.
Feedback analysis revealed that positive feedback strongly correlated with higher retention rates.
Seasonal trends showed significant spikes in spending during holiday months.
Based on the findings, I recommended strategies to improve customer loyalty:

Introduce targeted loyalty programs for high-value customers.
Focus on improving customer experience in underperforming regions.
Develop category-specific marketing campaigns to drive repeat purchases.
Skills Demonstrated:

Data preprocessing and cleaning in Excel.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Customer segmentation using clustering techniques (K-means).
Database management and querying using MySQL.
Data visualization and storytelling through Power BI.
Actionable recommendations to improve customer retention.
